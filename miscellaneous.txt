This txt file is just for us to jog down any things we find during any part of development. 
For visual easiness in reading, I think we put new things at the end of this file (instead of in the beginning like in to_do txt)

Duo Chen: 
> Notification chats are ignored by option, but if someone send a sub-message with chat-inducing content (such as a birthday), 
  chat will increase in speed. The specific classification may depend on our manual bias. I put it as "other". 
  Someone else may put it as "special topic". This point can be brought up in project report. 

> Twitch has this functino of betting with channel points. For now, treat those points as arbitrary currencies that 
  does not have monetary value. Bets can be "will this game be a win", or such. At the end of a bet, chat typically speeds up. 
  The classification depends on people, I put it on "other". 

> There are parts where the streamer meets a hacker in game. 
  Some chat's reactions are very similar to amusement at first, and then they mostly talk about it. 
  This also depend on person, but I put them as amusement because the reaction in the beginning is close to amusement. 

> Some classifications are really rare, such as disappointment and shock. 
  From my clips up to this point, I have about one in disappointment and none in shock. 
  But of course, such thing depends on manual labeling bias and characteristics of the streamer.

Duo Chen: 
> category of clips does depend on type of streams, I added in new horror game vods and there is an increase in shock 
  class clips. 

> many clips has chat turning from one reaction to another within a time-span of two minutes, 
  such as from shock/scared to amusement.  

> a lot of noise in chats, mostly new viewer joining in, or people with irrelevant topics. 

Nate: 
> Different parameter specifications in clipping create data-inconsistency in manual processing

JingTian Li: 
> Some streamers grew a chat community that has minimal reaction. Or their reaction is merely formality
  or majorly topic oriented. 

> Games are usually vocabularily distinct
